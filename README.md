## Tinder
### Version 1: Assignment 2
First, I focused on replicating the UI of the iconic swipe screen, which I broke down into 3 components.
- Top bar - includes the settings and chat icons and the Tinder logo
- Main view - contains the profile card
- Action bar - bar containing all the buttons that users interact with

These are the screenshots I was aiming to mimic:

To create a responsive application that runs and has a consistent look on both iOS and Android, I made sure to use the component 'Flexbox' with the stylesheets.

To clean up my code and make the later steps easier to keep organized, I then turned each of the 3 parts into its own custom component.
